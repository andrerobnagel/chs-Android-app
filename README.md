chs-android-app
===============

The official Columbine Android app. It allows for quick and easy viewing of staff directories, calendars, schedules, and more. It pulls data from the web and formats it in a native Android view.

There isn't anything really special about the source code; it can be used for references or examples on how to do certain things. This repository is mainly just a backup of the code, and a way for me to learn about GitHub.

The IDE used was Eclipse Juno. The minimum api level required is 8.
